I made this app for learning basic concepts about rails like routes, MVC and CRUD with sql.


## How to use this app?
First of all you need the following software installed on your computer:
- Ruby version -> 3.2.2
- Rails version -> 7.0.5

To run this app you might need to run the following command to install dependencies: `bundle install`

Then you need to run `rails s` or `rails server` to run the app and it will open on localhost:3000.
